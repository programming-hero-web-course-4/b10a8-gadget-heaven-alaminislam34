## React Fundamental Concepts

### I used essential react fundamentals in this project to enhance functionality, including:

- components: Modular structure for organized reuseable code.
- Hooks: Efficiently managed component lifecycles and side effects.
- Conditional Rendering: Inproved user experience by showing content based on conditions.

## Features

- JSX: JavaScript allows writing HTML inside it, making it simple and readable.
- React Router: React Router has been used in this project to display different components on the same page seamlessly.

- Hooks: I have used several hooks in React here, such as useState, useEffect, useContext, useLoaderData, and useLocation.

##

What I have used for data handling and management

- Context API: I utilized the Context API to pass data between components, simplifying the data management process and making the project much more efficient.
